## Description
This is a website about myself (Paul Meier). The website is mostly written in pure HTML & CSS, with the exception of the 'contact' pages which contain a few lines of PHP (written by myself) to handle submission of the contact form. I did this to avoid using an external form handling service.

The website is deployed on my own live server with a domain name that I purchased.

The project uses a CSS Keyframes Slider written by Stephen Scaff (https://github.com/stephenscaff/keyframes-slider)

## Project 'Mood Board'

I wanted to have a dark theme and 'professional' "feel" for my portfolio website using bold white fonts against semi-transparent dark backgrounds with images behind them.

## Project 'Wireframes'

I used a fixed-centered column/container for the main content of my website, while the header and the footer are also fixed to the top and bottom of the users browser. This means that ony the content in the main container is "scrollable", while the page's background images are fixed.

## Page 'Concepts'

I wanted to make the page background images viewable through the page content, so I used semi-transparent page containers. Also, the website header and main navigation are also semi-transparent, while the website footer is left completely opaque.

## Short Answer Q&As

Question 1

Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today.

-------

A network of computers connected using phone lines (ARPANET) was deployed in the 1980s. But this network could not communicate with others (Featherly 2019). Thus, a way for 'packets' of information to move between computers called the Transfer Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) was developed (Cert & Khan 1974), which has formed the foundation of the internet in 1983.

The decentralised Domain Name System (DNS) came next (Mockapetris 1983), allowing fast translation of IP addresses. A short time later, Tim Berners-Lee conceived and developed the World Wide Web, HTML, HTTP and URLs (Berners-Lee 1989).

Mobile phones evolved into smartphones, putting the internet in people's pockets.

Social media grew in popularity from 2003 onward.

Timeline of social media:

Today, more than 50% of adults around the world use it (see graphic below):

Today, the connectivity of the early internet is being extended further with the Internet of Things, AI and big data. This period is known as Industry 4.0.

Question 2

Define and describe the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers.

-------

Domains are a human readable address that is easy for us to recognise and remember. When you try to access a domain, the users computer send a request across the internet in what are called “packets” of information.
The web browser might have already visited the domain in the past, hence information may be stored in the browsers cache.
A domain name will be resolved to an IP address by the receiving server via its DNS (Domain Name Server). 
For example, www.google.com may resolve to 216.58. 199.46

The web server should receive your request and respond by sending you the page you want. Otherwise, it should send you an error message.

The server receiving the request from the will send packets of information back to the source of the request.
After compiling all of the packets of information, the users browser will render the webpage.



Question 3

Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today.

-------

I would like to reflect on todays use of social media. 

As someone who was born and grew up into adulthood well before the introduction of social media, I definitely believe that  social media has had a profound impact on society, both positive and negative.

In a way, social media has actually given many people the ability to be LESS social … in real life. As in introvert, I am guilty of this myself, shying away from invitation to meet people and opting to stay home and converse with friends online.
Then on the other hand, it can be a great way to keep in touch with people and organise events to meet up with friends.

There has also been a huge impact on people’s privacy, with advertising platforms being built in to products such as facebook, purely to take advantage of people private data.

Todays technological age actually makes it difficult to avoid social media, as many services now depend on people having a social media account of some kind.
