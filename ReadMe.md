## Description
This is a website about myself (Paul Meier). The website is mostly written in pure HTML & CSS, with the exception of the 'contact' pages which contain a few lines of PHP (written by myself) to handle submission of the contact form. I did this to avoid using an external form handling service.

The website is deployed on my own live server with a domain name that I purchased.

The project uses a CSS Keyframes Slider written by Stephen Scaff (https://github.com/stephenscaff/keyframes-slider)

## Project 'Mood Board'

I wanted to have a dark theme and 'professional' "feel" for my portfolio website using bold white fonts against semi-transparent dark backgrounds with images behind them.

## Project 'Wireframes'

I used a fixed-centered column/container for the main content of my website, while the header and the footer are also fixed to the top and bottom of the users browser. This means that ony the content in the main container is "scrollable", while the page's background images are fixed.

## Page 'Concepts'

I wanted to make the page background images viewable through the page content, so I used semi-transparent page containers. Also, the website header and main navigation are also semi-transparent, while the website footer is left completely opaque.
