## Description
This is a website about myself (Paul Meier). The website is mostly written in pure HTML & CSS, with the exception of the Contact pages which contain a few lines of PHP (written by myself) to handle submission of the contact form. I did this to avoid using an external form handling service.

The project uses a CSS Keyframes Slider written by Stephen Scaff (https://github.com/stephenscaff/keyframes-slider)
